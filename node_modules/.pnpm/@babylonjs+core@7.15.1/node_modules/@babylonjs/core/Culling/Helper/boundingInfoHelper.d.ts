 * Utility class to help with bounding info management
 * Warning: using the BoundingInfoHelper class may be slower than executing calculations on the CPU!
 * This will happen if there are a lot of meshes / few vertices (like with the BrainStem model)
 * The BoundingInfoHelper will perform better if there are few meshes / a lot of vertices
 * #BCNJD4#56 =\> does not use the BoundingInfoHelper class, performs calculations on the CPU
 * #BCNJD4#55 =\> same as #56 but use the BoundingInfoHelper class
 * #BCNJD4#40 =\> example with bones and morphs (webGL2)
 * #BCNJD4#42 =\> example with bones and morphs (webGPU)
 * #HPV2TZ#475 =\> only morph (webGL2)
 * #HPV2TZ#476 =\> only morph (webGPU)
 * #B8B8Z2#51 =\> Large scale test (CPU) =\> for each mesh, this test calculates a bounding box which is the union of the bounding boxes of all the frames in a given animation
 * #B8B8Z2#49 =\> Large scale test (webGL2)
 * #B8B8Z2#50 =\> Large scale test (webGPU)
